🔥  When to Use Abstract Class vs Interface?

✅ Use Abstract Class When:

✔ You want some methods with implementation and some abstract methods.

✔ You need instance variables that change per object.

✔ You need constructors.

✔ You want single inheritance.


✅ Use Interface When:

✔ You want 100% abstraction (No method implementation).

✔ You need multiple inheritance (since Java allows implementing multiple interfaces).

✔ You want to define constants (final static variables).

✔ You are defining a contract for other classes.

Abstract                                            Interface 

| Feature              | Abstract Class                       | Interface                                  
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Methods**         | Abstract + Concrete                   | Only Abstract (Java 7), Default & Static (Java 8) 
| **Variables**       | Instance Variables                    | Only `public static final` (Constants)    
| **Constructor**     | ✅ Yes, can have                      | ❌ No constructor                         
| **Inheritance**     | Can extend one class                  | Can implement multiple interfaces     
| **Access Modifiers**| Any access modifier                   | public by default                     
| **Performance**     | ✅ Faster (Concrete methods)          | ❌ Slightly slower (Runtime resolution)   
| **Usage**           | When partial abstraction is needed    | When 100% abstraction is required
